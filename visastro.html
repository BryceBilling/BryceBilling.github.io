                    <p class="text">
                        Observations from radio telescopes are stored in multi-dimensional arrays (3-dimensional
                        data
                        cubes
                        or higher) which are then analysed by radio astronomers. This analysis is enabled by the use
                        of
                        multiple visualization tools. While these tools are incredibly powerful, they have many
                        limitations
                        which are exacerbated by the sheer scale the data is reaching, with projects like the SKA
                        predicting
                        an <a

                        We believe existing software can be improved by involving users in interface design and
                        implementing
                        features that make user's lives easier, like overlaying optical catalogues or giving users
                        the
                        ability to select subvolumes and automatically analyse them.

                        alt="Final Iteration of the Prototype Interface Design">

                    <p class="text">
                        Frequent consultation with domain experts produced a much more usable, useful and effective
                        interface, making this approach worthwhile. The overall design improved over iterations and
                        expert
                        users felt the final design was an improvement on existing interfaces. Novel features such
                        as
                        comparisons, annotations and capturing images were highly useful additions. These findings
                        can
                        be
                        applied when developing types of other scientific software as well.

                    <h3>Overlay of Optical Data Catalogues</h3>
                    <img src="visastro/assets/images/overlay_overview.png" alt="Overlay with Optical Catalogue Loaded">

                    <p class="text">
                        Results showed that the overlay is easy to use and the markers were relatively accurate.
                        This
                        functionality is likely to reduce the number of manual operations and help astronomers
                        easily
                        visualize points of interest such as galaxy clusters.
